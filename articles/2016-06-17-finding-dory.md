## Project Overview

Finding Dory brought audiences back to the underwater world of the Great Barrier Reef and beyond, following Dory's journey to find her family. As a layout artist on this sequel, I helped establish the visual foundation for new oceanic environments while maintaining the beloved aesthetic of the original Finding Nemo.

## Key Contributions

### Underwater Environments
- Designed camera staging for the Marine Life Institute's vast aquarium systems
- Created layouts for kelp forest sequences and open ocean travel
- Developed staging for the California coastline and rocky tide pools
- Collaborated on the intricate pipe systems and tank environments

### New Location Development
- Established visual language for the Marine Life Institute facility
- Created layouts for Dory's childhood home in the coral reef
- Designed staging for the quarantine and rehabilitation areas
- Worked on the dramatic truck chase and highway sequences

## Technical Challenges

Finding Dory required balancing several environmental elements:
- Realistic marine biology research translated into appealing underwater worlds
- Complex water simulation and caustic lighting effects in layout planning
- Multi-level aquarium environments with intricate glass and water interactions
- Seamless transitions between different aquatic environments and scales

## Visual Development

The layout work encompassed both familiar and new underwater territories:

* The bustling, multi-level Marine Life Institute with its complex tank systems
* Dory's childhood reef home with its warm, protected coral gardens
* The vast open ocean during migration sequences
* The dramatic rocky coastlines of California's marine sanctuaries

## Character-Specific Staging

Special attention was paid to staging that emphasized each character's unique movement patterns:
- Dory's erratic but determined swimming style
- Hank the octopus's camouflage and shape-changing abilities
- Bailey and Destiny's echolocation and swimming behaviors
- The sea lions' terrestrial and aquatic movement

## Environmental Storytelling

The layout work supported the emotional journey by using environmental design to reflect Dory's memory fragments and her growing confidence in navigation.

## Research and Authenticity

Extensive research into marine biology and aquarium design informed the layout choices, ensuring both scientific accuracy and visual appeal in the underwater environments.

## Final Thoughts

Finding Dory challenged us to expand the underwater world established in Finding Nemo while introducing new environments that felt both scientifically grounded and emotionally resonant. The layout work needed to support both intimate character moments and spectacular underwater vistas, always serving the story's themes of family, memory, and finding one's way home.
