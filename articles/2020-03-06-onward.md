## Project Overview

Onward brought together modern suburban life with classic fantasy adventure, creating a unique world where magic exists alongside mini-malls and highways. As a layout artist, I helped establish the visual foundation for this story of brotherhood and self-discovery.

## Key Contributions

### Suburban Fantasy World
- Designed camera staging for the modern fantasy neighborhood of New Mushroomton
- Created layouts for the van road trip sequences across diverse magical landscapes
- Developed staging for the high school and family home environments

### Quest Adventure Sequences
- Collaborated on epic mountain and forest environments
- Established scale relationships for magical creatures and environments
- Worked on action sequences involving the cursed geysers and bridge collapse

## Technical Challenges

Onward required balancing several visual elements:
- Modern suburban environments with fantastical inhabitants
- Classic quest adventure landscapes
- Character staging that emphasized the relationship between Ian and Barley
- Seamless integration of practical and magical elements

## Visual Development

The layout work spanned both mundane and magical environments:

* Suburban streets filled with centaurs, elves, and pixies
* The family home with its mix of modern appliances and magical artifacts
* Epic mountain vistas and ancient ruins
* The dramatic underground sequences near the film's climax

## Final Thoughts

Onward presented the unique challenge of making a world feel both fantastical and familiar. The layout work needed to support both intimate family dynamics and epic adventure moments, always serving the central theme of finding magic in everyday relationships.
