Coco was a deeply personal project that required extensive cultural research and authentic representation. As a layout artist, I helped create the visual foundation for both the vibrant world of the living and the spectacular Land of the Dead.

## Cultural Authenticity First

Every layout decision was informed by our research into Mexican culture, architecture, and traditions. We worked closely with cultural consultants to ensure our staging honored the communities we were representing while serving the story's emotional needs.

The responsibility was immense - we weren't just creating pretty pictures, but representing a rich culture with respect and authenticity.

## Santa Cecilia's Living World

The town of Santa Cecilia needed to feel alive with generations of family history. Our layout work emphasized the layered nature of the community - how families, traditions, and architecture build upon each other over time.

Key staging principles included:

* **Vertical composition**: Multi-story buildings showing family connections
* **Warm, intimate framing**: Close-ups that emphasized family bonds
* **Environmental storytelling**: Every corner filled with cultural details
* **Natural gathering spaces**: Layouts that showed community interaction

## The Land of the Dead

Creating layouts for the Land of the Dead was an extraordinary challenge. We needed to design impossible architecture that felt both fantastical and rooted in Mexican artistic traditions. The vertical city required new approaches to depth and scale in our compositions.

The key was making the impossible feel natural:

* **Impossible scale**: Buildings that defied physics but felt logical
* **Vibrant color**: Layouts that supported the rich, celebratory palette
* **Flowing movement**: Camera work that danced through the vertical city
* **Cultural motifs**: Architecture inspired by Mexican folk art traditions

## Music and Movement

The film's musical heart influenced every aspect of our layout work. We developed staging approaches that would enhance the musical performances, using camera movement and composition to support the rhythm and emotion of each song.

Different musical moments required different layout strategies:

* **"Un Poco Loco"**: Energetic, handheld-feeling camera work
* **"Remember Me"**: Intimate staging that emphasized emotional connection
* **"La Llorona"**: Dramatic, reverent compositions worthy of the moment
* **Family gathering songs**: Wide shots that showed community celebration

## Generational Storytelling

The film's themes about memory, family, and tradition were supported through layout choices that emphasized connections across generations. We used staging to show how the past influences the present, how family stories shape identity.

The layout work needed to feel alive with the same energy that drives Mexican musical traditions, creating a visual rhythm that complemented the film's incredible soundtrack.

## The Final Performance

Miguel's climactic performance for Mama Coco was perhaps the most emotionally challenging sequence to stage. We needed layouts that could handle the intimate scale of a grandmother and grandson while carrying the weight of the entire family's emotional journey.

Every angle was carefully chosen to support the song's power to restore memory and reconnect family bonds. The layout work had to disappear completely, allowing the performance and emotion to take center stage.

Working on Coco taught me that layout artistry at its best serves something larger than visual storytelling - it serves the preservation and celebration of human culture and connection.
