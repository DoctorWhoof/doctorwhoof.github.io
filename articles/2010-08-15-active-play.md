One of the last things I did at Blur, this one was short and sweet. We used the Goldfish Crackers characters to animate a campaign promoting sports to kids. We also got to do a cartoon version of NBA star Dwyane Wade. The result was fast and colorful, and I still kinda like it, even after all these years.
