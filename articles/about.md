I was born in Brazil, son of a writer and a teacher, raised in beautiful Rio de Janeiro and currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was always fascinated with films, animation, comic books and video games since I was a kid, so it's natural that I ended up doing something related to that for a living.

After working for a few years in Rio de Janeiro, I spent about 8 years doing Animation at Blur Studio in Venice, California, where I started doing Animation and Layout, eventually started supervising animation and then directed some projects in my last two years there.

In 2010, I joined Pixar Animation Studio to help create a feature film called Brave, and I've been there ever since, working in the Camera and Staging department. My job is to create a kind of prototype of the film, often using temporary dialogue and music, and with very rough-looking animation and lighting, since the point is not how it looks, but how it plays.

We experiment with camera placement, lenses and shot choreography. Then we collaborate with the editors, so we can refine the storytelling and find solutions that feel believable from a narrative perspective and work well in a three dimensional space.

Thanks for your interest!
