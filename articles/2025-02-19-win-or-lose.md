## Project Overview

Win or Lose marks Pixar's first original series, exploring the perspectives of different characters surrounding a pivotal little league softball game. As a layout artist on this groundbreaking project, I helped establish the visual foundation for multiple character viewpoints, creating environments that supported both intimate personal stories and the communal energy of youth sports.

## Key Contributions

### Multi-Perspective Storytelling
- Designed camera staging that shifted between different character viewpoints of the same events
- Created layouts for the central softball field from multiple angles and emotional perspectives
- Developed staging for home, school, and community environments that reflected each character's unique experience
- Collaborated on visual transitions that maintained continuity across different episode perspectives

### Sports Environment Design
- Established the softball field as both a realistic sports venue and an emotional battleground
- Created layouts for dugouts, bleachers, and sideline areas that supported character-driven storytelling
- Designed staging for practice sequences, team meetings, and pre-game preparation
- Worked on crowd scenes and spectator areas that enhanced the community sports atmosphere

## Technical Challenges

Win or Lose required careful attention to:
- Maintaining spatial consistency across multiple character perspectives of the same locations
- Creating environments that could support both comedic and dramatic storytelling moments
- Balancing realistic sports settings with the heightened emotions of youth competition
- Designing layouts that worked within episodic television production constraints

## Visual Development

The layout work encompassed the full world of youth sports:

* The central softball diamond with its dusty infield and well-worn bases
* Team dugouts filled with nervous energy and personal belongings
* Suburban neighborhoods where characters live and practice
* School hallways and classrooms where friendships and rivalries develop

## Character-Specific Environments

Special attention was paid to how each character experiences the same spaces differently:
- The pitcher's mound as both a place of triumph and anxiety
- The batter's box from perspectives of confidence and fear
- The bleachers as seen by supportive parents and nervous relatives
- The dugout as a space of team unity and individual pressure

## Community Storytelling

The layout work emphasized the communal aspect of youth sports, showing how a single game impacts an entire community of players, families, and coaches.

## Series Format Innovation

Working on Pixar's first original series required adapting feature film layout techniques to episodic storytelling while maintaining the studio's signature visual quality.

## Emotional Geography

Environmental staging supported each episode's unique emotional perspective, using familiar locations to tell very different stories about competition, friendship, and growing up.

## Final Thoughts

Win or Lose challenged us to create layouts that served both the universal experience of youth sports and the individual stories of each character. The work required understanding how the same physical space can feel completely different depending on who's experiencing it, always ensuring that environmental design supported the series' exploration of perspective, empathy, and the shared experience of competition.
