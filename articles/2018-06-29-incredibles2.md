## Project Overview

Incredibles 2 brought the Parr family back to the big screen with explosive action sequences and intimate family moments. As a layout artist, I contributed to creating the visual foundation for this superhero sequel that balanced spectacular set pieces with heartfelt character development.

## Key Contributions

### Modern Architecture and Design
- Developed camera staging for the sleek, mid-century modern environments
- Created layouts for the luxurious DevTech headquarters and facilities
- Designed staging for the Parr family's new home and neighborhood

### Action Sequences
- Collaborated on high-speed chase scenes through city environments
- Established scale and staging for Elastigirl's motorcycle and helicopter sequences
- Worked on complex multi-character fight choreography in confined spaces

## Technical Challenges

Incredibles 2 required careful attention to:
- Retro-futuristic architecture that felt both period-appropriate and timeless
- Dynamic action staging that showcased each character's unique powers
- Intimate family moments that contrasted with spectacular superhero sequences
- Jack-Jack's unpredictable power manifestations and their environmental impact

## Visual Development

The layout work encompassed both domestic and spectacular environments:

* Sleek corporate headquarters with dramatic glass and steel architecture
* Cozy family home spaces that emphasized character relationships
* High-speed chase sequences through urban landscapes
* The climactic showdown aboard the DevTech yacht

## Character-Specific Staging

Each family member's unique abilities required specialized camera and environmental staging:
- Elastigirl's flexibility and reach in urban environments
- Mr. Incredible's strength in confined domestic spaces
- Violet's invisibility and force fields in social situations
- Dash's speed in both indoor and outdoor sequences

## Family Dynamics

Special attention was paid to staging family interactions, using environmental design and camera positioning to reinforce the themes of teamwork, communication, and growing up.

## Final Thoughts

Incredibles 2 challenged us to create layouts that served both spectacular superhero action and intimate family storytelling. The work required balancing the scale of superhero adventures with the relatability of everyday family life, always ensuring that the spectacular never overshadowed the emotional core of the story.
