## Project Overview

Working on Luca was an incredible journey into the sun-soaked Italian Riviera. As a layout artist on this project, I had the opportunity to help bring the charming coastal town of Portorosso to life.

## Key Contributions

### Town Layout and Staging
- Designed camera angles for the bustling town square sequences
- Collaborated on the underwater to surface transformation scenes
- Developed staging for character interactions in narrow Italian streets

### Technical Challenges
- Balancing the contrast between underwater and surface world environments
- Creating believable scale relationships between human and sea monster forms
- Optimizing complex town geometry for efficient rendering

## Visual Development

The layout work focused on capturing the authentic feel of Italian coastal architecture while supporting the story's magical realism. Key scenes included:

* Market square gatherings
* Vespa chase sequences through winding streets
* Clifftop vista reveals
* Underwater cave systems
