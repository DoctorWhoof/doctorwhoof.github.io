## Project Overview

Elio represents Pixar's ambitious journey into the cosmos, following a young boy who becomes Earth's intergalactic ambassador. As a layout artist on this upcoming project, I helped establish the visual foundation for both intimate Earth-based sequences and spectacular alien worlds, creating environments that balanced scientific wonder with heartfelt storytelling.

## Key Contributions

### Cosmic Environment Design
- Designed camera staging for vast alien landscapes and otherworldly civilizations
- Created layouts for the intergalactic headquarters and diplomatic spaces
- Developed staging for Elio's transformation from ordinary kid to cosmic representative
- Collaborated on the seamless transitions between Earth and alien environments

### Character and Scale Integration
- Established visual relationships between human-scale characters and cosmic settings
- Created layouts that emphasized Elio's journey from small-town life to universal significance
- Designed staging for alien creature interactions and cultural exchange sequences
- Worked on the dramatic reveal sequences of alien civilizations and technologies

## Technical Challenges

Elio required unprecedented attention to:
- Believable alien world design that felt both fantastical and scientifically grounded
- Complex lighting scenarios for multiple alien sun systems and cosmic environments
- Scale relationships between Earth environments and vast intergalactic spaces
- Integration of diverse alien species and their unique spatial requirements

## Visual Development

The layout work encompassed both familiar and extraordinary environments:

* Elio's hometown with its relatable suburban charm and family dynamics
* The spectacular intergalactic council chambers with their alien architecture
* Diverse alien worlds, each with unique environmental rules and visual languages
* Spacecraft interiors that balanced functionality with alien design aesthetics

## Storytelling Through Environment

Special focus was placed on using environmental design to support Elio's character arc:
- Small-town Earth environments that emphasized his ordinary beginnings
- Increasingly spectacular alien spaces that matched his growing confidence
- Intimate character moments within vast cosmic settings
- Visual metaphors for belonging and finding one's place in the universe

## Scientific Wonder

The layout work drew inspiration from real astronomical phenomena while creating environments that served the story's themes of curiosity, exploration, and universal connection.

## Cultural Exchange

Environmental staging supported the film's themes of communication and understanding across different worlds and species, using visual design to bridge cultural gaps.

## Final Thoughts

Elio challenged us to create layouts that served both cosmic spectacle and intimate coming-of-age storytelling. The work required balancing scientific wonder with emotional authenticity, always ensuring that even the most extraordinary alien environments felt connected to Elio's personal journey of self-discovery and belonging in the vast universe.
