## Project Overview

Soul presented a unique opportunity to explore both the vibrant streets of New York City and the ethereal realm of the Great Before. As a layout artist, I contributed to creating the visual foundation for this deeply philosophical and musically rich story.

## Key Contributions

### New York City Environments
- Developed camera staging for jazz club performances
- Created layouts for busy Manhattan street sequences
- Designed intimate spaces for Joe's apartment and music studio

### The Great Before
- Collaborated on the abstract, otherworldly environments
- Established scale and spatial relationships in non-physical realms
- Worked on transition sequences between Earth and spiritual planes

## Technical Challenges

The dual nature of Soul's world required careful consideration of:
- Realistic urban environments grounded in authentic NYC references
- Abstract spiritual realms that defied conventional spatial logic
- Seamless transitions between dramatically different visual languages

## Visual Development

Layout work encompassed both grounded reality and fantastical abstraction:

* Jazz club intimate performance spaces
* Bustling New York street corners and subway stations
* The vast, luminous expanses of the Great Before
* Cozy barbershop and family gathering spaces

## Musical Integration

Special attention was paid to staging musical performances, ensuring camera work enhanced rather than distracted from the jazz performances that formed the heart of the story.

## Final Thoughts

Soul challenged us to create layouts that served both intimate character moments and grand philosophical concepts. The work required balancing realistic environments with abstract spiritual spaces, always in service of the story's exploration of purpose and passion.
