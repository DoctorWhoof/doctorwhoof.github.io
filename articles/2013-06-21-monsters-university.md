## Project Overview

Monsters University took audiences back to the world of Monsters, Inc., exploring Mike and Sulley's college years in a prequel that required establishing entirely new environments while maintaining the beloved aesthetic of the original film. As a layout artist on this project, I helped create the visual foundation for the sprawling university campus and its various academic and social spaces.

## Key Contributions

### Campus Environment Design
- Designed camera staging for the iconic Monsters University campus with its gothic architecture
- Created layouts for the various school buildings, dormitories, and academic facilities
- Developed staging for the Scare Games competition sequences across multiple campus locations
- Collaborated on the library, lecture halls, and student gathering spaces

### Scare Games Sequences
- Established visual language for each of the six Scare Games challenges
- Created layouts for the dramatic finale in the human world
- Designed staging for the underground tunnels and door warehouse sequences
- Worked on the various fraternity and sorority house environments

## Technical Challenges

Monsters University required careful attention to:
- Establishing a believable university campus that felt both academic and monstrous
- Creating environments that supported both comedy and character development
- Balancing nostalgic college atmosphere with the unique monster world aesthetic
- Designing spaces that could accommodate monsters of vastly different sizes and shapes

## Visual Development

The layout work encompassed the full spectrum of university life:

* The grand campus quad with its imposing gothic buildings and monster-scaled architecture
* Intimate dormitory rooms that reflected different monster personalities
* The high-tech Scare Simulator and training facilities
* Various challenge environments for the Scare Games competition

## Character-Specific Staging

Special consideration was given to staging that emphasized the relationship dynamics:
- Mike's small stature in the imposing university environment
- Sulley's natural confidence contrasted with academic challenges
- The diverse monster student body and their unique physical requirements
- Group dynamics within the fraternity and sorority settings

## Comedy and Character Development

The layout work supported both comedic beats and character growth by using environmental design to enhance personality conflicts and friendships.

## Educational Environment Design

Research into real university campuses and collegiate gothic architecture informed the layout choices, creating an authentic academic atmosphere adapted for the monster world.

## Final Thoughts

Monsters University challenged us to create layouts that served both the nostalgia of college life and the unique demands of monster society. The work required balancing familiar university tropes with innovative monster-world design, always ensuring that the campus felt both academically rigorous and monstrously fun, supporting the story's themes of friendship, personal growth, and finding one's true calling.
