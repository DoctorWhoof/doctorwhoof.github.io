## Project Overview

The Good Dinosaur presented a unique challenge in Pixar's catalog - combining photorealistic natural environments with stylized character design. As a layout artist on this project, I helped establish the visual foundation for Arlo's epic journey through the American frontier wilderness.

## Key Contributions

### Natural Environment Design
- Designed camera staging for vast wilderness landscapes and river valleys
- Created layouts for the dramatic storm sequence and its aftermath
- Developed staging for the frontier homestead and cornfield environments
- Collaborated on the treacherous mountain terrain and canyon sequences

### Journey Structure
- Established visual progression for Arlo's long journey home
- Created layouts that emphasized scale between small dinosaur and vast landscape
- Designed staging for the various encounters with other dinosaur species
- Worked on the climactic river rapids and flood sequences

## Technical Challenges

The Good Dinosaur required unprecedented attention to:
- Photorealistic landscape rendering integrated with stylized characters
- Dynamic weather systems and their impact on environment staging
- Complex water simulation for river and storm sequences
- Seamless day/night transitions across multiple climate zones

## Visual Development

The layout work spanned diverse American frontier environments:

* The family farm with its terraced cornfields and pastoral valley setting
* Dense prehistoric forests with towering ancient trees
* Dramatic canyon systems and rocky badlands
* Rushing rivers and peaceful meadows under vast skies

## Character and Environment Integration

Special focus was placed on staging that emphasized the relationship between character and environment:
- Arlo's small scale against the overwhelming natural world
- The contrast between safe domesticated spaces and wild frontier
- Environmental obstacles that drove character growth and determination
- Landscape as both antagonist and ally in Arlo's journey

## Emotional Geography

The layout work supported the emotional arc by using environmental progression to mirror Arlo's internal journey from fear to courage.

## Research and Authenticity

Extensive research into American frontier landscapes, geological formations, and paleontological environments informed every layout decision, creating believable prehistoric wilderness settings.

## Final Thoughts

The Good Dinosaur challenged us to create layouts that served both spectacular natural beauty and intimate character storytelling. The work required balancing photorealistic environmental complexity with clear narrative staging, always ensuring that the vast American wilderness felt both magnificent and emotionally connected to Arlo's personal growth journey.
